## Conclusion
The survey reveals important insights into the mental health experiences and perceptions of tech workers. Overall, the data suggests that while mental health is often treated with the same priority as physical health in tech companies, concerns remainâ€”especially regarding the potential career impact of being identified as having a mental health issue. Men in particular are more likely to worry about the stigma associated with mental health conditions.  

The majority of respondents report positive experiences with employer support for mental health, with few witnessing poor employer responses. However, anxiety and mood disorders are notably prevalent among respondents, highlighting the need for more targeted mental health resources and support within the industry. While a small group has experienced or observed inadequate responses to mental health issues, overall, the findings suggest that tech companies are making strides in providing mental health resources, though more work is needed to ensure all workers feel fully supported.  

The survey underscores the importance of continuing to address mental health stigma and ensuring equitable, accessible care for employees in the tech industry.
